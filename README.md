1. Install Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Run ```cargo build --release``` in the directory
3. The executable can be moved for easier access (```mv target/release/sleepy-rustaceans-lang srl```)
4. Run the executable either with a test file (```./srl testfile```) or without where lines will need to be input manually
